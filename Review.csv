Bart,31/03/2022,"This is the first time I‚Äôve ordered from this restaurant and having read the reviews, my experience was excellent. Great quality of food, hot, decent portions and arrived on time. Thank you and I will be ordering again!"
Xin,29/03/2022,The food wasn't bad but didn't taste as good as Red Onion.
sagar,26/03/2022,"I ordered 4 dishes totalling ¬£24 , didn't even received any salad and a smashed pappadom which I paid for. Appalling"
Bee,20/03/2022,"First time ordering, great food and really authentic. Had Balti Butter which was amazing, one of the best curries I‚Äôve had in a while! Will definitely be going back again"
Dean,15/03/2022,"Really not nice throw in the bin , never ordering from here again , tasted like jar food like from supermarket .. and before dilwar comments back saying it's fresh it's really not compared the korma to a jar I had from local discount supermarket and it was exactly the same consistently. People buy from you cause they want made from strach not shop bought jars . What a waste of time and money"

Restaurant unhelpful and  refused to let me take the food back and directed me to complain to just eat which I have. Also have to pay out for food somewhere else for family visiting. Very poor, will not use again!"

Wayne,20/11/2021,"Absolutely the worst Indian takeaway I think I‚Äôve ever had!!
Tasteless, dry, overcooked, soggy, RIDICULOUS amount of salt. The whole lot went in the bin after we all tasted it and agreed it was terrible. Does the chef actually taste anything as he cooks it?? No way I‚Äôd recommend this to anyone."

Lija,26/08/2021,The chicken tikka delivered yesterday was too salty. I couldn‚Äôt eat it even after washing the chicken. I‚Äôm very disappointed. The biriyani was descent
Mohammed,25/08/2021,Even though food arrived 45 mins late I wouldn‚Äôt complain about that as not the drivers fault. All the chaos is due to reading festival. Giving 4 stars reason too much oil in chicken karahi. Food was as usual tasty.

Jogeswar,10/07/2021,"I have been ordering from Dilwar for a long time now, food is absolutely delicious as usual, my favourite go to restaurant for good Indian food. I must say about their exceptional service as well. When I placed my order today, the address I selected was different than my current address (Just Eat app did not select the address based on the current location). However, they delivered to the correct address quickly with food being still hot after been to the wrong address, which was quite far. Very much appreciated the extra effort."
Jogeswar,08/07/2021,None
Melis,04/07/2021,"The food tasted flavourless, I hoped it would be good as many people recommended this place... samosas were very dry.. the pilau rice was not good either. Chicken curry was very watery."
Paul,01/07/2021,"Its a long time since I used this Takaway because I have been disappointed in the past. However, this was a completely different experience. Food was really hot, well cooked, meat tender, sauces delicious and plenty of food. I ordered the set meal for two and even through I am a big eater there was sufficient for more modest sized meals for 3. I will definitely use this takeaway again. Keep up the good work.."

Tried to explain to him i cant come outside of my hotel room because im quarantining but he wouldnt understand and started being rude. He then later said customer is not always right and he has too much pressure on his head. Not an excuse to be rude to customers and not give them the service they pay for. Staying well clear from this restaurant, should be removed from JustEat. Appalling!!!"

Jilesh,06/02/2021,3 out of the 4 dishes tasted good.  The pindi chicken biriyani was a let down.  It was described as a Pakistan style chicken biriyani.  The chicken was really dry and the whole dish was really bland. No comparison between this dish and  the one available at YaadGaar on Oxford road.

It would be better if they were honest. The food is great tho when hot (ours was cold) I would recommend collecting from them or they could get some more drivers. 

The longevity of the business is at risk if you dont take on board feedback. Im not one to usually leave feedback but in this instance I was very disappointed as my previous experiences have been alot better."

The Paneer was under cooked and more like cold rubber than cooked cheese. The Naan was cold and the rice was mixed pilau with cold mushrooms thrown on top. All in All very disappointed and I ended up throwing the whole meal away

Ray,08/11/2018,"Possibly the worst way I‚Äôve ever spent nearly ¬£25, lets start with the positives, The rice was ok, now the rest‚Ä¶. Chicken Donner was tasteless the naan it sat upon was like chewing through rubber, the meat pieces cut so small it was like roughly chopped minced chicken, the half tandoori chicken was so so dry and yet sitting in so much smoky flavoured water, to be honest maybe the worst tandoori I have ever eaten, not sure what it was marinated in but certainly not the yogurt and spices I have been used to in the past, even the yogurt mint sauce was like water, next comes the ¬£2 slice of bread they referred to as a naan, again it was like rubber and even worse than any supermarket naan I have ever attempted to eat, now for the main dish that was sold as Ceylon King Prawn, now this was classic, over cooked rubber prawns sitting in a thin fire water, no flavour whatsoever other than fiery chillies, goodness knows how hot their Phall curries would be if this was anything to compare to, again nothing like the many Ceylon curries I have tasted either here in Reading or elsewhere. One prawn and one mouthful was all that was necessary to decide that this was going nowhere except the bin. This is the first time I have tried this takeaway, and most definitely the last. I can in all honesty say that I have never ordered a meal so poor in my entire life, and I‚Äôd be surprised if I was as unlucky to order another,Sadly I‚Äôm sure I have to give a minimum of 1 star, personally I would give it (minus)-4 stars if I could.  I bought this as a treat to sit and watch through the football, but instead went to my freezer, got out some onion bhaji‚Äôs and opened a pkt of mini poppadums and had with assorted chutney and lime pickles instead but hey, the delivery guy was pleasant, always good to finish on something nice to say. 
P.S. Has everywhere stopped giving the odd poppadum for free?"

James,05/07/2018,"BE AWARE IF YOU MAKE ORDER OVER THE PHONE AND PAY BY CARD THEY WRITE DOWN YOUR BANK CARD DETAILS! Found out other evening while making my takeaway order over the phone that they write down your card details and then process your payment through the card machine after you have hung up.I placed my order then wanted to pay by card, I was then asked for my card details which I gave over the phone. At this point I realised I hadn't been told how much my order was so I asked. The staff member told me to wait as he worked it out. I asked how he just processed my payment if he didn't know how much it was? Then he told me he had wrote my card details down on paper.I thought they had been put straight into the card machine as it should be done.I was passed onto the owner who asked me if I wanted to cancel the order and pick it up instead and pay on arrival. I pointed out this would make no difference as you have already got my card details written down on paper. And the whole idea of a takeaway was so I didn't leave my house.

Bev,26/06/2018,"the Owner turned up with the delivery with the order, but said some of the items were not on the menu which were on Just Eat, he said as a regular customer he had my order which I ordered, but after checking my order it was smaller potions than usual and the Curry very watery. The owner told me to contact Just Eat for a refund which I did, but after Just Eat contacting Dilwar they refused to give the refund. I am so sad because I have used Dilwar for at least 20 years, so if is the way they treat their regulars then I'd rather not be a part of it."

mel,09/04/2018,First time we've ordered from here and certainly won't be the last... was the best kebab we've had in a long time. Meat was cooked just right and tasted lovely. Liked that it was served in naan bread instead of pitta... and price was good compared to other restaurants - portions were good size too... Would definitely recommend üòÅ
George,03/04/2018,"Quite honestly the worst curry I‚Äôve had. The consistency was like squash, I even stirred in my own flour to try to give it some thickness. Was not nearly spicy enough either. Seriously üëéüèª."
Grant,30/03/2018,food was great! came 20 minutes early was really hot still large portions on the lamb pathia with very tender meat sag aloo was also great sized and delicious! Impressed as it was my first trying here!

I really hope this restaurant lose the current Chef's !! these guys are absolute authentic and worth every penny, great customer service also, thank you"
tahira,07/10/2017,"First and last time I'll be ordering from this place . Burnt pakoreh, watery tasteless tarka daal,  uncooked fish.  This is dangerous, feeding people food that could potentially harm them. Waste of money and very disappointed as I only ordered due to the reviews."

Owen,26/08/2017,Ordered a vegetable biryani but it did not come with curry sauce. Since when does biryani not come with curry sauce as standard?!? Thankfully I'd ordered a Dahl as well so could use that as a curry for the rice but I essentially bought very expensive vegetable rice. The Dahl was very oily. The food was all too salty. We called the restaurant to ask where the curry sauce was and the man was rather rude and basically said it should never come with sauce and we have it completely wrong in this country. Will not be using them again.

Didn't expect this from this restaurant as ordered before as well and the food was pretty good then. Very disappointed. Will not order again

Maxwell,25/03/2017,Ordered cod and chips. Fish was tasteless and weirdly tough.... Cod usually flakes off but the fish I received was tough and horrible. Sag paneer was under seasoned. Keema naan was nice though
Jack,23/03/2017,Long wait for food plain naan delivered instead of cheese naan and forgot about drink the food that came was lovely though
Rohan,18/03/2017,"tonight's food wasn;t great !
the pizza base is bit gooey & cheese was kind of bit burnt, tasty crust however, the mixed kebab meat was too dry and only laced with a lot of chilli sauce that has lots of sugar in it , guys the chilli sauce you use on kebabs are so cheaply made & it doesnt taste right, you need to make your own fresh chilli sauce for kebabs, not enjoyed the kebab tonight,the salad on kebab is very tired ( seems like they were cut this morning & not fresh ) , i know Pindi express does good biriyanis and curries but with pizza and kebab quality we are very disappointed"

Others have left negative comments regarding Poppadoms but mine were fine, Crisp, not greasy. 
A few complimentary items 
 "" Thank You "" 
Will use again ."
Dal,23/02/2017,"Awful awful food, one of the worst pizzas I have ever had. Hardly no sauce, minimal cheese and scarce on toppings. The chicken wings were dry and hard - wouldn't use again. On the postive delievery was within the time stated but most of it went into the bin after a few bites"
